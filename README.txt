This folder contains the code to the Non-Local-Means denoising algorithm
implementation.
NonLocalMeansGray.m is a code that runs for grayscale images.
NonLocalMeans_patchWise.m runs a patchwise implementation of the NLM.

(not included here is the basicSection.m template since it was not 
used in this implementation of the NLM)
